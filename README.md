Welcome to the Angular Boot Camp Curriculum. This repository
contains much of the example code we use in teaching
[Angular Boot Camp](https://angularbootcamp.com/),
available here to use in class, or for developers everywhere to refer
for (hopefully) high quality examples of specific Angular topics.

Some of the examples have explanation inline, but of course we provide
extensive explanation during Angular Boot Camp.
